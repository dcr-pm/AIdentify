# AI.Dentify — Static Web App

AI.Dentify is a simple browser‑based tool for detecting whether text, images, videos, or audio clips have likely been generated by AI. It uses lightweight heuristics to compute a confidence score and flags potential signals of synthetic content — all directly in your browser (no backend).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the folder via a static web server. There is **no build step required**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-dentify.git
cd ai-dentify
# Optionally run a local web server for better file access
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Deploying to Netlify

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and push this code.
2. Log in to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and choose **New site from Git**.
3. Connect your GitHub account and select your AI.Dentify repository.
4. Since this is a purely static site, **leave the build command blank** and set the **publish directory** to `/` (the repository root).
5. Click **Deploy site**. Netlify will build (instant) and assign a unique URL. You can set a custom domain under Site settings.

Every commit to your `main` branch will automatically update your Netlify deployment.
